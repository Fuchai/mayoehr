We are interested in drug-related deaths. drug.csv contains the ICD-10
codes that indicate drug-related deaths.

/infodev1/rep/projects/jason/drugrepid.csv contains all death records
/infodev1/rep/projects/jason/drug_users.txt contains all users.

I did an intersection with ICD10 codes. There are 5847 drug users, 1465 drug-related
causes of deaths, and 164 cases of intersection. The incidence rate is too
low for a meaningful study. This study design is paused for now.
